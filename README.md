# Analyzing-and-Mitigating-Interference-in-AM-and-FM-Communication-Systems

In this project we will neck down to the basics and delve into the theory and applications of Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Frequency Modulation (FM) in communication systems. To achieve this, it models real-world reception conditions by injecting Gaussian noise and other impulsive interference onto AM and FM signals. The project includes implementing and assessing interference suppression methods such as notch filters to enhance the quality of signals. Analysis processes in detail with one of the main performance metrics being signed as SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio). The study is summarized with well-written step by step documentation showing the approach, results, and performance of the modulation and different interference mitigation support schemes.
